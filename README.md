# Implement Perceptron-based Linear Discriminant Functions. 

## The data set to be used is the following sample set comprising a two-class problem.
= [(2, 7); (8, 1); (7, 5); (6, 3); (7, 8); (5, 9); (4, 5)]
= [(4, 2); (-1, -1); (1, 3; (3, -2); (5, 3.25); (2, 4); (7, 1) ]

## Implemented the following algorithms

### Single-sample perceptron
### Single-sample perceptron with margin
### Relaxation algorithm with margin

In each case, ploted the data points in a graph (e.g. red: class- and blue: class- ) and also showed
the weight vector learnt from all of the above algorithms in the same graph (labeling clearly
to distinguish different solutions).

Ran each of the above algorithms for various initial values of the weight vector, and analysed the dependence of convergence time (run-time) on initialization.
